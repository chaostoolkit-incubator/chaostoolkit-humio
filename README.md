# chaostoolkit-humio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-humio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-humio)

This project is an extension for the Chaos Toolkit to target [Humio][humio].

[humio]: https://www.humio.com/

## Install

This package requires Python 3.5+

To be used from your experiment, this package must be installed in the Python
environment where [chaostoolkit][] already lives.

[chaostoolkit]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit

```
$ pip install -U chaostoolkit-humio
```

## Humio Dataspace & Token

To use this extension, you will need two pieces of information from Humio.
First, the dataspace which you want to send logs to. Second a [API token][token]
for an user with permissions to that space.

[token]: https://cloud.humio.com/docs/http-api/index.html#api-token

## Usage

To use this extension, edit your [chaostoolkit settings][settings] by adding the
following payload:

[settings]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/settings/

```yaml
notifications:
  -
    type: plugin
    module: chaoshumio.notification
    space: my-space
    token: my-token
```

By default all events will be forwarded to that channel. You may filter only
those events you care for:


```yaml
notifications:
  -
    type: plugin
    module: chaoshumio.notification
    space: my-space
    token: my-token
    events:
      - run-failed
      - run-started
```

Only sends those two events.

## Test

To run the tests for the project execute the following:

```
$ pytest
```
